# sealth
Estimating, plotting, predicting carbon emissions of metro seattle. Desired technology: Apache Beam, Kafka, Docker, Terraform, Geopandas, Geojson.

### Objective 1:
- Estimate carbon emissions , ideally by neighborhood or zip code

### Objective 2:
- Be able to plot those emissions:
  - Metropolitan area
  - Zip code

### Objective 3:
- Predict future carbon emissions given a point in time and present inputs
- Optional, configure predictive exogenous inputs

# namesake
Chief Sealth (c. 1786 – June 7, 1866), was a Suquamish and Duwamish chief. The city of Seattle was named after him. A widely publicized speech arguing in favor of ecological responsibility and respect of Native Americans' land rights had been attributed to him.
