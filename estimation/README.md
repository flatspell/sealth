# Estimation

#### Notes
The total household carbon footprint, HCF, of any individual
105 or population can be expressed simply as the product of
106 consumption, C, in dollars or physical units, and emissions per
107 unit of consumption, E, summed over each emissions activity
108 (i) included in the model

HCF = âˆ‘ C Ei i

We use existing national household survey data to develop
111 econometric models of demand, C in eq 1, for transportation,
112 residential energy, food, goods, and services. Independent
113 variables used to predict household electricity, natural gas and
114 other household heating fuels in the Residential Energy
115 Consumption Survey19 (n = 4363) include energy prices,
116 heating fuel type, heating and cooling degree days, structure of
117 homes (number of rooms, percent single-detached, year home118 built), demographic information (income, number of house119 hold members, age of householder, race), home ownership,
120 percentage rural or urban, Census divisions, and U.S. state.
121 Predictive variables for motor vehicles miles traveled (VMT) in
122 the National Household Travel Survey20 (n = 11 744) include
123 number of vehicles owned, fuel prices, average time to work,
124 percentage of commuters who drive to work, demographic
125 information (income, number of household members, race),
126 number of food and recreation establishments in the zip code,
127 population density, Census region, and U.S. state. Independent
128 variables for 13 categories of goods and 11 categories of
129 services in the Consumer Expenditures Survey21 (n = 6965)
130 include household size and income. The total number of
131 independent variables used in all models is 37, all of which were
132 also compiled for zip codes for prediction purposes. Regression
133 coefficients, t-statistics, and p-values for each independent
134 variable, in addition to model summary statistics (adjusted r

),
135 various tests of model validation and description
